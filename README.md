INDIA-VS-CANADA
===============

a svg image that I created by parsing meaningless data which I designed
<br>
We always find some data and try to visualise it. So I was thinking to do it reversely from another perspective.<br>
In my DATA VIZ project, I start from wondering if Chinese got the most permanent employment certification to find the data from US GOVERNMENT which shows India got the most permanent employment certification, then start to think about if it means it's easy for India to get that. However, after I explored deeper, I found the answer is no. The rate of Canada comes first. I know this story can continue, I might continue telling this story, but let's call it chapter 1. OK?
<br>
Let's talk back to this image, the usual steps for us to visualise data is as following:<br>
1. find data
2. visualise it<br>
But what I tried to do in this project is what I want to visualise then I create the data myself.
It's just an idea and I think it's interesting. So don't be too serious with it. <br>
If you take a look at the csv file, you smart would understand what I was trying to do. :)
Hope you enjoy!
